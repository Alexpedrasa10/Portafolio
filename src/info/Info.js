I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

    bio: "Iâ€™m a self-taught backend developer specializing in building scalable and robust solutions. Since 2020, Iâ€™ve delved into web technologies, combining curiosity with the ability to solve complex problems. At Key Data, I apply my skills to optimize systems and work with international clients.",
    work_experience: "My career began in October 2020 at Key Data as a Frontend Developer (AngularJS), before transitioning to backend development with PHP Laravel. Over time, I expanded my expertise in database management and server administration, eventually leading my team by 2023, resolving critical production issues. I later joined South Hive as an Ssr Backend Developer, where I contributed to CÃ³rdoba's municipal tax and financial systems, creating new features and migrating projects to the cloud. Currently, I'm back at Key Data, managing multiple projectsâ€”primarily a healthcare-focused initiative in Colombiaâ€”and contributing to an AI-driven project.",
